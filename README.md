# Fano's C# Console Game Engine
A just-for-fun project with the goal of porting the OLC Console Game Engine to C#

Create a sub-class of the `ConsoleGameEngineBase` class and implement its abstract methods to get started!

See the included example project for guidance.

Shoutouts to [Javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA) for the inspiration!
